Our objective aims to design a Smart Home for Visually-Challenged People of Deter-
mination to help them in their day to day life routines.Currently, the industrial going
with the idea of smart homes. Smart home is a house equipped with gadgets that make
your life easier like: smart lights, heater, oven and other devices that you control it re-
motely using your voice or your smart phone. Buying many smart devices to make your
home smart is expensive right now as every device alone not cheap. So, we developed
super sensor, it is one device that monitor all the activities in your house or office,can
be used to gather all sort of information within its perimeter like: the temperature in
the room or the number of people and turn on/off a device using your voice assistance
.This is by simply placing one device in each room, so we can easily monitor the sta-
tus of the house.This device should help Visually-Challenged people of determination
to interact with the environment around and to know information about it using voice
commands.Our system work by:

• First,The user issue a command to any Alexa device.

• Alexa check the Jovo application to open the right skill

• Alexa check the Firebase ,collect the answer then answer the user

• Finnaly ,all the information inside the Firebase is the measurements of the sensors
we used ,then using Pyaudio library and machine learning Alexa can answer the
status of the room like the temperature ,Water consumption and the light status,
etc..
